Participants: Jaylon, Aaron, Ricardo, Seth, Ben
Notes: For ur next project sprints we will code on our own branch so we will not get too many merge conflicts. We have been working together with a few branches but sometimes when someone works on the same branch we often have merge conflicts. We will work better on our templates and jira now since we know exactly how ths should be.
